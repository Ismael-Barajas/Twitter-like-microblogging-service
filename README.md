## About 
This project creates a Twitter-like microblogging service where users can post messages, repost messages, view global messages, see a timeline of messages from other users, narrow timelines to consist of only users they are following, follow or unfollow users, update user profile info, see who you are following and who is following you, like messages, create polls, and view/respond to polls. This service is implemented using 5 RESTful back-end services which make use of SQL databases, Redis, DynamoDB, http basic authentication, and a service registry.
